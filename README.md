The idea behind MusicLearn(ML) is to build a model to classify songs based on their lyrics by using naive Bayes classifier.
We have used 10-fold cross validation to train in the dataset. The dataset has been downloaded from the Million Song Dataset Subset. We then filtered this dataset to a 1000-song training dataset and 200-song test dataset.
